## Alert Detail



### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Content-Security-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; img-src * 'self' data: https:;`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined: 
img-src, frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ In Page Banner Information Leak ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10009/)



##### Low (High)

### Description

The server returned a version banner string in the response content. Such information leaks may allow attackers to further target specific issues impacting the product and version in use.

* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca/robots.txt
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Apache/2.4.52`
  * Other Info: `There is a chance that the highlight in the finding is on a value in the headers, versus the actual matched string in the response body.`
* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca/sitemap.xml
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Apache/2.4.52`
  * Other Info: `There is a chance that the highlight in the finding is on a value in the headers, versus the actual matched string in the response body.`

Instances: 2

### Solution

Configure the server to prevent such information leaks. For example:
Under Tomcat this is done via the "server" directive and implementation of custom error pages.
Under Apache this is done via the "ServerSignature" and "ServerTokens" directives.

### [ Permissions Policy Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10063/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``

### [ Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10036/)



##### Low (High)

### Description

The web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to.

* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)`
  * Other Info: ``

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "Server" header or provide generic details.

### [ Loosely Scoped Cookie ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90033/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.

* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `The origin domain used for comparison was: 
abcd.google0.ca
CrmOwinAuth=ABCD
`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

### [ Re-examine Cache-control Directives ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10015/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content. For static assets like css, js, or image files this might be intended, however, the resources should be reviewed to ensure that no sensitive content will be cached.

* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `cache-control`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

For secure content, ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate". If an asset should be cached consider setting the directives "public, max-age, immutable".

### [ Storable and Cacheable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users.  If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`
* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca/robots.txt
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`
* URL: https://abcd.google0.ca/sitemap.xml
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`

Instances: 3

### Solution

Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information.  If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.
